# java-charts-webui

Web user interface for creating charts and diagrams.

## Usage

You can run `java -jar java-charts-webui.jar` to start the server. The server will be bound to `127.0.0.1:80`, so you should be able to open http://localhost/ in your browser. Stop the server using `Ctrl`+`C`.

I had some problems with Windows 11, but I can't figure out what caused them. So if in doubt, use a Linux system. Also make sure that only you can access the web server.

Its use is largely self-explanatory: adjust the code for generating the functions and click on Send Code; the result will then be visible below.
